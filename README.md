# Crystal Collector Game

This game asks the player to attempt to match their score to the target score by clicking on the crystals. The catch is that the value of each gem is hidden, so the player will need to determine each crystal's value for the best chance at winning. It was created using a combination of html, javascript, bootstrap, and some light css.


## Getting Started

 1. Each crystal has a hidden value
 2. Click the crystal and your score will increase by the hidden value assigned
 3. The goal is to make your score match the target score 
 4. If you accomplish this, you win the round
 4. If your score goes above the target score, you lose the round.
 5. After you win/lose the game will reset with a new target and new hidden values for each crystal.

####### Tips: 
-- "Your Score" will increase each time you select a crystal. Try to figre out the value of each crystal before attempting to match the score
-- It may help to have a calculator nearby if math isn't your strong suit
-- ** Hint: No crystal will have a value above 12 **
